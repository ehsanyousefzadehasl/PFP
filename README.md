# Paper Figure Plotter

This is repository keeps our first scientific figure plotting experience of our first paper. In this repositry, we try to produce figurePlotters to make paper authors' life easier.

Step 1) We implemented some figure plotters that are able to produce nice plots that you can use in your papers (Specially Computer Science Papers). You can see them as follows:
1. One column figure plotters source codes [here](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/tree/master/01-One_Column_figure) and samples [1](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/01-One_Column_figure/one_column_type1_output.pdf), [2](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/01-One_Column_figure/one_column_type_2_output.pdf), [3](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/01-One_Column_figure/one_column_type_3_output.png)
2. Two column figure plotter source codes [here](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/02-Two_column_comparsion_Figure/two_column_comparison.py) and its sample [here](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/paper_figure_plotter/blob/master/02-Two_column_comparsion_Figure/two_column_comparison_figure_output.pdf)
3. Three column figure plotter source codes [here](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/03_Three_column_comparison_Figure/three_column_comparison_figure_plotter.py) and its sample output [here](https://github.com/ehsanyousefzadehasl/PFP/blob/master/03_Three_column_comparison_Figure/three_column_comparison_figure_plotter_output.pdf)
